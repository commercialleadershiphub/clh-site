      <h1>Customer Onboarding Blueprint: Turning Promises into Measurable Value</h1>

      <p>Winning a deal is not the finish line. It is the starting gun for the first 90 days that decide whether the customer becomes a reference, an expansion account, or an at-risk logo. Those 90 days are also where internal relationships either click — or fracture. Without clarity, Sales is accused of “throwing deals over the fence”, Success feels they inherit unrealistic promises, Support gets blamed for delays, and Product hears about gaps second-hand. That dynamic breeds an “us vs. them” culture that slows delivery and erodes trust.</p>

      <p>Leaders fix this by making onboarding a <strong>cross-functional, measured, and predictable</strong> process: clear roles, documented promises, a visible 90-day plan, and a cadence of check-ins. Predictability matters because teams prepare better when they know what will be reviewed and when. Onboarding is also the launchpad to value: when outcomes and adoption are explicit, time-to-value (TTV) shrinks, renewals strengthen, and expansion becomes credible.</p>

      <h2>Why onboarding is a leadership responsibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-functional alignment.</strong> Onboarding is the first moment where Sales, Success, Support, and Product must execute together. Leaders who orchestrate this well create collaboration; leaders who neglect it create silos.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer perception.</strong> Economic buyers form a long-term view of reliability in the first month. A sloppy handover is hard to recover from.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue impact.</strong> Poor onboarding drives early churn; strong onboarding drives adoption, renewals and expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal credibility.</strong> Enforcing strong handovers shows back-office teams that Sales cares about outcomes, not just signatures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Handoff gaps</strong> — Sales closes, Success isn’t ready, customer feels abandoned.</li>
        <li><strong>Unclear ownership</strong> — Customer doesn’t know who to call; internally nobody is accountable.</li>
        <li><strong>Unrealistic expectations</strong> — Verbal promises never captured; scope surprises appear in week five.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcomplexity</strong> — Too many steps, no clear timeline; customer disengages.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal blame games</strong> — “Us vs. them” between Sales and the rest of the org.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Playbook: Customer Onboarding in Practice</h2>

      <h3>Step 0: Pre-close preparation</h3>
      <p><strong>Owner:</strong> Sales (A), Success (C), Customer (C). <strong>Deliverable:</strong> 1-page <em>Outcome Brief</em> stored in CRM.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Document business outcomes, stakeholders, promises/constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Script (Sales):</strong> “Before we sign, meet Sarah who will guide you after closing. She’ll own the 90-day plan so you see value quickly.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 1: Internal handoff (30 min, within 1 business day)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review Outcome Brief; confirm <strong>RACI</strong> for onboarding.</li>
        <li>Draft kickoff invite and attach the 90-day skeleton plan.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2: Customer kickoff (60 min, within 3 business days)</h3>
      <p><strong>Participants:</strong> Project owner, economic buyer (if possible), CS/Implementation lead, Sales.</p>
      <p><strong>Minute-by-minute:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>0–5: Welcome + intent — “Our goal is to get you to [Outcome] within 90 days.”</li>
        <li>5–15: Reconfirm outcomes and success criteria.</li>
        <li>15–30: Walk the 90-day plan (milestones, owners, dates).</li>
        <li>30–40: Roles &amp; RACI, who to call for what.</li>
        <li>40–50: Risks and assumptions; capture blockers now.</li>
        <li>50–60: Next steps with dates; confirm weekly check-ins.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Follow-up (24h):</strong> Send recap + final 90-day plan as a one-pager.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: The 90-day plan</h3>

      <h4>Phase 1 (Days 1–30): Setup &amp; training</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Access + integrations configured; role-based training (recorded).</li>
        <li>Reach first <em>time-to-first-value</em> event (e.g., first automated report to Finance).</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly check-in script:</strong> “One outcome this week, any blockers, and one commitment per side.”</li>
        <li><strong>Example blocker:</strong> Finance missed training → run a focused 20-min session just for Finance; record and send.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Phase 2 (Days 31–60): Adoption &amp; usage</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Set adoption targets by role (weekly active %, key feature usage).</li>
        <li>Send a simple weekly usage snapshot to the project owner.</li>
        <li><strong>Intervention rule:</strong> If adoption misses target two weeks in a row, run a 45-min <em>Usage Intervention</em> with one concrete workflow change for the next week.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Phase 3 (Days 61–90): Value review &amp; executive alignment</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare a 2-page ROI/adoption summary vs. original outcomes.</li>
        <li>Hold a 60-min executive review (wins, gaps, adoption by role, next-quarter priorities).</li>
        <li>Discuss expansion only if adoption is healthy.</li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>Make the flow visible: handoff, define success, plan, enable, drive adoption, show value.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Step 4: Internals that prevent “us vs. them”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain a shared <em>Customer 360</em> (outcomes, milestones, health score, next actions).</li>
        <li>15-min weekly internal sync (CS, Implementation, Support; Sales joins if exec air cover is needed).</li>
        <li>Use a light service blueprint to link front-stage touchpoints to back-stage work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 5: Measurement</h3>
      <p><strong>Customer-facing:</strong> TTV (days), adoption by role, milestone completion on time, Day-60 pulse.</p>
      <p><strong>Internal:</strong> Onboarding completion ≤90 days (% accounts), forecastable health score (usage + stakeholder engagement), early churn and first-year expansion.</p>

      <h3>Step 6: Recovery protocol</h3>
      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Missed milestone + low adoption + negative pulse.</p>
      <p><strong>Run a 45-min reset:</strong> Re-state outcomes, agree a two-week rescue plan with one visible win, assign exec sponsors on both sides.</p>
      <p><strong>Script:</strong> “We’re behind plan. Here is what we will deliver in 14 days to give you a concrete win — and what we need from you.”</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Onboarding is the bridge between promise and reality. Treat it as a shared, outcome-driven system and you strengthen trust inside and outside the company. Predictability encourages preparation; value realization encourages renewal and expansion. That is why the best leaders obsess over onboarding.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps: 90-Day Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Today (30–45 min):</strong> Draft the Outcome Brief. Book internal handoff and customer kickoff placeholders for all new wins.</li>
        <li><strong>Within 3 business days of close:</strong> Run handoff; finalize RACI and 90-day plan. Hold kickoff; send recap within 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> Complete access + integrations; deliver role-based training; achieve first TTV event and communicate it to the executive buyer.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 3–8:</strong> Weekly check-ins with usage snapshot; run a Usage Intervention if adoption misses target twice.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 9–12:</strong> Executive value review; set next-quarter priorities; discuss expansion only if adoption is healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> RACI tune-up; service-blueprint review to remove friction; share two improvements with the commercial org.</li>
      </ul>
