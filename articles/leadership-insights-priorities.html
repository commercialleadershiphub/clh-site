      <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> When every team member champions their own top task, progress stalls. Leaders must act as Chief Clarity Officers—clarify non-negotiables, rank priorities together, and lock in visible commitments.</p>

      <h2>Audience & situation</h2>
      <p>This article is for leaders managing teams where competing priorities constantly derail focus. It applies to cross-functional projects, busy startups, and any setting where “everything feels urgent.”</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>If everyone pushes their own agenda, the team’s energy scatters. The result is frustration, missed deadlines, and zero clarity about what actually matters.</p>

      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>When priorities are unclear, no one wins. Without alignment, leaders waste time firefighting instead of building momentum toward shared goals.</p>

      <h2>Solution model</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarify the non-negotiables</li>
        <li>Rank priorities as a group</li>
        <li>Lock in visible commitments</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-step guide</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Clarify the non-negotiables:</strong> Define the “must-haves” and make them explicit.</li>
        <li><strong>Rank as a group:</strong> Facilitate open discussion to create a clear, shared order of importance.</li>
        <li><strong>Lock in commitments:</strong> Document the priorities and review them daily or weekly with a visible scoring system.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Example or mini case</h2>
      <p>A software team faced constant feature debates. The leader introduced a “Weekly Big Three” list. Every Monday, the team agreed on the top three tasks. Progress became trackable, and tension dropped dramatically.</p>

      <h2>Checklist or template</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Define your non-negotiables</li>
        <li>Facilitate group ranking</li>
        <li>Publish the final list</li>
        <li>Review weekly with a scoring system</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Metrics & pitfalls</h2>
      <p><strong>Metrics:</strong> % of team tasks aligned with top 3, reduction in conflicting priorities, weekly progress scores.<br>
      <strong>Pitfalls:</strong> Endless debate, vague commitments, failing to revisit priorities.</p>

      <h2>Next steps & CTA</h2>
      <p>Start with your next team meeting: align on the Weekly Big Three. Test the approach for four weeks and measure clarity and results.</p>
