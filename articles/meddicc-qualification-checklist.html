      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Most teams say they use MEDDICC, but few make it operational. Reps fill a template once, managers skim a slide, and by the time the quarter ends, the real gaps reveal themselves: no economic buyer access, vague decision criteria, single-threaded relationships. Forecast misses follow, confidence drops, and leadership adds pressure instead of clarity.</p>
      <p>So many organizations proudly include MEDDICC as part of their sales methodology, yet little actually changes on the ground. Reps fill out a MEDDICC template once per deal and managers glance at it during QBRs, but it never becomes part of the daily sales motion. The framework ends up as a box-ticking exercise disconnected from how deals are actually run.</p>
      <p>Predictably, quarter-end reviews still reveal the same preventable mistakes. Deals marked as “Commit” fall through because no true Economic Buyer was engaged. Others slip because the team never confirmed real Decision Criteria or cultivated a strong Champion. In short, the team 'did MEDDICC' in name only — without real enforcement it didn’t change the outcome.</p>
      <p>The problem isn’t the acronym — it’s the lack of proof and discipline. MEDDICC only works when it lives in your weekly rhythm and inside your CRM fields, not in someone’s notebook. Definitions must be unambiguous, inspection must be based on evidence, and stage progression must depend on what the customer has actually confirmed, not how a rep feels about a deal.</p>
      <p>For example, a rep might say they have a Champion, but do they have proof — like that Champion introducing them to the Economic Buyer or pushing internally? MEDDICC forces that proof. Similarly, identifying “pain” isn't just writing down a problem; it means the customer has confirmed the pain and its impact. By requiring concrete evidence for each letter (a customer email, meeting, or document), you replace guesswork with verified facts at every stage.</p>
      <p>This playbook focuses on turning MEDDICC into a system you can run. It gives you simple checklists, stage gates and scripts that fit directly into pipeline reviews and 1:1s. Each letter is defined in terms of observable behavior and artifacts: the meeting that happened, the email that confirms criteria, the mutual close plan the buyer accepted. If something is missing, the deal doesn’t move. That’s how you build quality and predictability.</p>
      <p>Adopting MEDDICC should not slow deals down or add bureaucracy. When implemented correctly, it speeds cycles by removing ambiguity early. Reps know exactly what to do next. Managers coach the gaps that matter. RevOps can report deal health without guessing. Finance sees the same reality, and execs stop being surprised at the end of the quarter.</p>
      <p>Different motions need different levels of rigor. SMB deals benefit from a lightweight checklist that catches the common failure points (no EB, no quantified impact). Enterprise deals require deeper artifacts (weighted criteria, mapped process, legal path). This guide shows both, with thresholds you can tune by segment and deal size.</p>
      <p>You don’t need a new tool. Start with a few CRM fields per letter, a simple score (0–3), and one shared folder for artifacts. Then run the inspection script every week. After four to six weeks, win rate rises, slip rate falls, and your commit becomes a number leadership can trust.</p>
      <p>The rest of this article is practical and specific: what “good” looks like for each letter, the exact questions to ask, how to score maturity, how to gate stages, and detailed examples from mid-market, enterprise, partner and PLG motions. Copy it, adjust thresholds to your world, and publish it to the team.</p>

      <h2>Playbook: make MEDDICC operational</h2>

      <h3>1) Add the right CRM fields</h3>
      <p>Create simple, required fields for each letter. Use checkboxes and dates where possible to keep data objective. Link docs (criteria sheet, mutual close plan, value model) in URL fields.</p>

      <h3>2) Define stage gates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Move to Validation:</strong> Pain articulated + Metrics draft.</li>
        <li><strong>Move to Proposal:</strong> Decision Criteria documented + Decision Process mapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Move to Commit:</strong> EB engaged &lt;14d + Mutual close plan accepted + Champion confirmed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Weekly inspection (script)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Show me EB last touch and what was decided.”</li>
        <li>“Open the close plan — what’s the next buyer action and date?”</li>
        <li>“Which criterion we are losing? What’s the counter?”</li>
        <li>“How is the champion helping us this week?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) Scoring rubric (0–3 per letter)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0:</strong> unknown or assumed</li>
        <li><strong>1:</strong> discovered verbally</li>
        <li><strong>2:</strong> documented and shared</li>
        <li><strong>3:</strong> validated by EB / reflected in plan</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Commit rule:</strong> Average score ≥2.3 and no letter &lt;2.</p>

      <h3>5) Enablement pack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>MEDDICC one-pager (this checklist)</li>
        <li>Discovery question bank</li>
        <li>Mutual Close Plan template</li>
        <li>Criteria &amp; Scorecard template</li>
        <li>Value model (calculator)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Discovery questions (use verbatim)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> “If we solved this, which KPI moves and by how much?”</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Buyer:</strong> “Who signs the agreement? Can we review the plan with them?”</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Criteria:</strong> “What would make you choose nothing? How do you weight must-haves?”</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Process:</strong> “What happens between verbal yes and signature? Who else needs to review?”</li>
        <li><strong>Pain:</strong> “What happens if this problem persists for another quarter?”</li>
        <li><strong>Champion:</strong> “Who would win internally if this succeeded? Can they sponsor our access?”</li>
        <li><strong>Competition:</strong> “Who else are you evaluating? Where do they fit your criteria better?”</li>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Worked examples (detailed)</h2>
      <h3>1) Mid-market SaaS (ACV $35k)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Wins stall after demo; deals slip because EB is absent and criteria are fuzzy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps by letter:</strong> EB unknown (E=0), Decision Criteria not written (Dc=1), Champion weak (Ch=1).</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Gate <em>Proposal</em> on “EB named + close plan draft”. Add CRM fields for <em>Criteria_doc_url</em> and <em>Champion_name</em>. Weekly inspection requires an EB touch &lt;14d.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Calendar invite with EB; criteria sheet shared; mutual plan with 3 milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome (2 qtrs):</strong> Win rate +9 pts; cycle time −12%; commit accuracy ±8%.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Enterprise — legal/security bottleneck (ACV $250k)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Deals die in legal; forecast misses due to end-of-quarter surprises.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Decision Process unmapped (Dp=0), no legal path (Dp), Risks not logged.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Require legal path + procurement method under Dp. Add risk register tag “Legal”. Gate <em>Commit</em> on legal path confirmed.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Process map with approvers + dates; legal quick-guide shared; fallback clauses prepared.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Slips −35%; legal lead time −18%; exec confidence improves.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Multi-BU expansion (land & expand)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Good first land, slow expansion; champions are local and lack reach.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Champion influence low (Ch=1); no enterprise metrics (M=1); EB not engaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Build an enterprise value model tying BU wins to group KPIs; promote a group-level champion; add EB briefing cadence monthly.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Executive narrative deck; cross-BU success metrics; EB briefing notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Expansion velocity +28%; average deal size +31%.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) PLG assist — converting high trial volume</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Many trials convert poorly; champions rarely emerge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Pain generic (I=1); Champion missing (Ch=0); no quantified value (M=0/1).</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Trigger human assist when a trial hits a usage threshold; run a 20-min value workshop; require a named champion before <em>Proposal</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Value canvas; champion plan with next internal action; criteria “time-to-value” documented.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> POC→paid conversion +14 pts; payback narrative shortens cycle by 10 days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Services-heavy solution (integration required)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Technical wins, economic losses; procurement blocks late.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> EB engaged too late (E=1); Decision Criteria favor feature not ROI (Dc=1, M=1).</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> ROI model made mandatory at Validation; EB review of the mutual plan; add “services estimate” and “integration owner” to Dp.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Signed scoping sheet; EB email confirming success metrics; services SoW template shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Win rate +7 pts; fewer “no decision”; margin variance narrows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Channel / partner-led opportunity</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Partner introduces late-stage deals with little visibility; forecasts volatile.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Unknown EB & criteria (E=0, Dc=0); Decision Process opaque (Dp=0).</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Partner MEDDICC mini-checklist. Require EB intro and criteria doc before pricing. Create a joint close plan owned by both AE and partner manager.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Three-party call notes; shared criteria sheet; joint plan in CRM.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Commit conversion +22 pts; partner-sourced forecast variance halves.</li>
      </ul>
