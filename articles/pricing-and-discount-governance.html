      <p class="muted">Protect margin, keep deals moving, and stop end-of-quarter chaos.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Discounts are not the problem — unmanaged discounts are. In many teams the loudest buyer or the most creative rep dictates price. Floors are unknown, approvals are ad hoc, and every quarter-end becomes a scramble where margin quietly disappears. The board asks why gross margin missed; the team blames “market pressure”.</p>
      <p>A good governance system removes drama. You define floors and approval bands in advance, set clear give-get rules, and publish legal guardrails for non-standard terms. Reps know what they can trade and for what. Managers inspect decisions with proof, not opinion. Finance and Legal are involved at the right moments, not as last-minute blockers.</p>
      <p>Price should be anchored in value and segmentation. The same product sold to different segments under different conditions should not carry the same realized price. Governance turns this from a hidden tribal rule into visible price fences: region, segment, volume, term, and channel. With fences in place, you can allow flexibility without losing control.</p>
      <p>Approvals must be fast or they become a tax on revenue. That means a simple matrix, documented SLAs, and a small pricing council to handle true exceptions. If a deal meets the criteria, approval is a formality. If it doesn’t, the rep knows what they need to trade to earn it — longer term, prepay, a reference, expanded scope.</p>
      <p>Legal risk is part of pricing. Concessions like MFN, unlimited liability or broad termination rights are price in disguise. The governance system prices those risks with predefined fallbacks and requires a higher approval tier. When Legal and Sales read from the same playbook, cycle time drops and “legal surprise” slips go away.</p>
      <p>Measurement closes the loop: realized discount, price variance, approval cycle time, and attachment rate of give-gets. You want fewer big, late exceptions and more disciplined trades that preserve value. Over a few cycles you’ll see margin stabilize, deal velocity improve, and quarter-end become boring — in a good way.</p>
      <p>This article gives you a complete, light-weight system you can implement in your current CRM and contract process in two weeks: definitions, approval matrix, give-get menu, legal guardrails, inspection scripts, cadence, and dashboards — plus detailed worked examples across SMB, mid-market, enterprise and channel motions.</p>

      <h2>Playbook: implement governance</h2>

      <h3>1) Set floors and fences</h3>
      <p>Publish List, Floor and Walk-away per segment, tier and region. Add fences for volume, term and channel. Make the card visible to all managers and in the quote tool.</p>

      <h3>2) Ship the approval matrix</h3>
      <p>Keep it to five bands. Add SLAs (e.g., Manager 4 business hours, Director 1 day, Council Wed/Fri only). Auto-route approvals from CRM and log outcomes.</p>

      <h3>3) Enforce give-get</h3>
      <p>No discount beyond the manager band without a trade. Use the menu and record the Get as a field in CRM and a line in the order form.</p>

      <h3>4) Guardrails for risky clauses</h3>
      <p>Publish a redline checklist with pre-approved fallbacks (liability, termination, MFN, data). Flag risky clauses as additional “price” requiring a higher approval band.</p>

      <h3>5) Inspection script (weekly)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Show list vs net and the price waterfall.”</li>
        <li>“Which Get are we trading for this Give?”</li>
        <li>“What clause will Legal push on? What’s our fallback?”</li>
        <li>“If we lost this tomorrow, what would the post-mortem say about price?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Cadence & council</h3>
      <p>Run a 30-min weekly pricing council: review exceptions, trends by segment, and stuck approvals. Publish decisions and update the card monthly.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Worked examples (detailed)</h2>

      <h3>1) Mid-market SaaS — 12% discount ask</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Prospect wants 12% off list for a 12-month term. Procurement references a cheaper tool.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Term short, no Get proposed, criteria not tied to value.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Offer 10% with 24-month term + prepay. Add value proof (cycle time −15%). If 12% is insisted, require both prepay and a public case study.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Value model; order form with 24m term and prepay clause; case study line item.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Net 10% discount, 2-year lock-in, cash up-front.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Enterprise — MFN + 25% demand</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Procurement asks for 25% and Most-Favored-Nation clause.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Risky clause priced at additional discount; MFN is red-lined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Decline MFN; offer volume ramp and term: 15% year 1, 10% year 2–3 with expansion commit.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Clause fallback; expansion schedule attached to order form.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Realized discount blended at 12%; MFN removed; expansion visibility gained.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Channel deal — partner margin vs end-customer price</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Partner requests extra margin to win a competitive bake-off.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Risk of double-discount (partner + end-customer).</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Cap extra partner margin at 5% only if end-customer discount ≤10% and with a 12-month resale commitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Partner addendum with volume/term; end-customer quote aligned to fence.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Healthy net price; partner commits pipeline for two quarters.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) Quarter-end panic — 30% request</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Rep asks for 30% on the last day of the quarter to “save the number”.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> No Get; approval exceeds VP band; legal risks unknown.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Council review only. Counter with 15% now + 3-year term + prepay + reference + QBR with EB in 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Exception memo; EB calendar invite; prepay/term on order form.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Closed at 15% with strong give-gets; avoided unhealthy precedent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Services-heavy implementation</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Customer negotiates hard on software and wants services free.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Margin leakage via services; unclear SoW scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Keep software discount at manager band; trade a small services credit for a 24-month term and two references; lock SoW with milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> SoW template with caps; reference schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Protected ARR; services margin preserved; predictable rollout.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Competitive RFP — low-price rival</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Rival bids 20% lower headline price.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> Criteria not weighted; apples vs oranges on scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Anchor on value and scope: match 10% with a bundle that delivers payback in 9 months; require 36-month term and reference.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Weighted criteria sheet; ROI calc; order form bundle.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Win at 10% discount with 3-year commitment and reference rights.</li>
      </ul>
