  <h1>QBR Playbook (Customer-Facing)</h1>
  <p class="muted">Prep, data pack, 60‑min agenda and crisp follow‑up that earns renewal and expansion.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Quarterly Business Review (QBR) is not a perfunctory slideshow or a brag sheet—it’s a critical meeting to prove your product’s value and plan the customer’s next wins. Too often QBRs devolve into a “show-and-tell” from the vendor, which bores executives and misses the customer’s real needs. A successful QBR flips the script: it’s a collaborative working session focused on the customer’s outcomes, blockers, and the path forward.</p>
    <p>This playbook helps you run QBRs that drive action. You will come prepared with data and a plan, engage the customer in reviewing progress and co-creating the next 90-day success plan, and leave with concrete commitments. Done right, a QBR strengthens the partnership, addresses risks early, and earns you the right to ask for renewal or expansion by demonstrating value.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Make the customer successful in the next 90 days and earn the right to expand. In other words, the QBR should leave the customer confident about the upcoming quarter’s plan and seeing you as a long-term partner.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Prep checklist</h2>
    <p>Ensure the following are completed 3–5 days before the QBR:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Data pack prepared and sent in advance** – A briefing with usage stats, outcome metrics, and industry benchmarks, delivered ~3 days prior so attendees can review.</li>
      <li>**Key attendees confirmed** – Especially the customer’s executive sponsor and power users. Make sure the right people will be in the room and ready to engage.</li>
      <li>**Next-quarter draft plan** – 2–3 clear options or proposals for the coming quarter’s goals and initiatives, so the QBR discussion can focus on choosing and refining a path.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Agenda (60 min)</h2>
    <p>Structure the one-hour QBR roughly as follows to cover past results and future plans:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Last quarter outcomes (10 min):</strong> Review the goals set in the previous period and what was achieved. Celebrate wins and acknowledge shortfalls with data.</li>
      <li><strong>Value blockers (10 min):</strong> Discuss obstacles or gaps that prevented greater success. Identify any missed requirements, support issues, or adoption challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>Next 90-day plan (30 min):</strong> Present and co-create the plan for the upcoming quarter. Walk through the proposed initiatives or projects (from your prep) and invite feedback. Gain agreement on outcomes, responsibilities (co-ownership between your team and the customer), and key dates.</li>
      <li><strong>Risks &amp; asks (10 min):</strong> Surface any risks that could threaten success (e.g. staffing changes, budget constraints) and ask what help the customer needs from you. Also state any support you might need from them (e.g. executive air cover, access to data) to execute the plan.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Artifacts</h2>
    <p>Have tangible takeaways that capture the QBR outcomes and keep everyone accountable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Success plan document:</strong> A one-page summary of the agreed 90-day plan (objectives, milestones, owners on both sides).</li>
      <li><strong>Risk &amp; dependency log:</strong> A living list of any risks, blockers, or dependencies identified, with owners assigned to address each.</li>
      <li><strong>Expansion hypotheses:</strong> A short list of potential expansion opportunities or upsells discussed, each with a trigger (e.g. “If metric X > Y by Q2, consider adding Module Z”). This seeds future growth conversations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Follow-up</h2>
    <p>After the QBR, follow through immediately:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>24-hour recap:</strong> Send a recap email within one day, thanking attendees and documenting the agreed goals, actions, owners, and timelines. This written record ensures everyone is on the same page.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule check-in:</strong> Before the QBR ends, or in the recap email, schedule a mid-quarter check-in meeting. Locking in that date now creates a built-in progress review and keeps momentum (no waiting until next QBR to course-correct).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thoughtful follow-up shows accountability and keeps the positive energy from the QBR moving forward.</p>
