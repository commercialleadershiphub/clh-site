<!-- Audience & situation -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Audience &amp; situation</h2>
  <p>For CS and Renewals leaders, AMs and CROs who own GRR/NRR. Use when health scores are noisy, “surprise churn” happens at quarter-end, or discounts are the default “save”.</p>
</section>

<!-- Introduction (long) -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Churn rarely starts at signature time — it starts months earlier when adoption stalls, a sponsor changes role, or value is never quantified. If those weak signals are invisible or unactioned, you get last-minute escalations, panicked discounts and learning loss. A strong renewal system flips this: detect risk early, diagnose the <em>cause</em>, run the correct <em>save play</em>, and communicate with calm predictability.</p>
  <p>This playbook defines a simple, explainable health model (5–7 factors), a save-play library tied to root causes (value gap, poor fit, budget, relationship), and a weekly “Save Room” rhythm that turns signals into action. It also covers escalation mechanics — who says what, to whom, and when — so executives bring air cover without derailing the team. Finally, we establish commercial guardrails to protect price integrity and avoid teaching customers that waiting equals discounting.</p>
  <p>Expect variation by segment. Enterprise accounts need formal governance, documented executive briefs and legal/proc pathways; mid-market needs a lighter version but the <em>same</em> structure, so data, coaching and results are comparable. The goal is not to eliminate churn — it is to shrink the “time-to-risk”, increase the “risk-to-green” rate, and preserve margin on renewals that should be kept.</p>
  <p>Use this as the standard across Success, Renewals and Sales. When everyone shares the same score, reasons, and plays, escalations are rarer, calmer and more successful.</p>

<!-- What good looks like -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What good looks like</h2>
  <ul class="muted">
    <li><strong>Explainable score:</strong> 5–7 factors with weights, thresholds and clear owner per signal.</li>
    <li><strong>Root-cause library:</strong> 8–10 save plays with owners, scripts and success criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Save Room:</strong> 30 minutes; highest-risk first; decisions captured; follow-ups assigned.</li>
    <li><strong>Executive briefs:</strong> one-page updates for Sev-A accounts; cadence pre-agreed.</li>
    <li><strong>Guardrails:</strong> discount requires counters (term, expansion, reference); post-mortem on every loss.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Common pitfalls -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Black-box scores:</strong> teams can’t explain or act on them.</li>
    <li><strong>One-size saves:</strong> same play for budget, fit and value problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Escalation theater:</strong> many leaders emailing, nobody owning outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Discount first:</strong> price used to fix adoption or relationship gaps.</li>
    <li><strong>No learning loop:</strong> loss reasons unstructured; same mistakes repeat.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Playbook -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Playbook</h2>

  <h3>1) Build a simple health model</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Pick 5–7 factors: <em>Usage</em> (WAU/Seats), <em>Adoption breadth</em>, <em>Outcomes</em> (KPI delta), <em>Support experience</em> (TTR, P1s), <em>Executive sponsor</em> (last touch), <em>Financial hygiene</em> (AR), <em>Contract posture</em> (term left).</li>
    <li>Weight by segment (e.g., Enterprise ↑sponsor, MM ↑usage). Define <em>Green/Amber/Red</em> thresholds.</li>
    <li>Create CRM fields: <em>Health score</em> (0–100), <em>Risk reason</em> (picklist), <em>Save play</em> (picklist), <em>Exec brief cadence</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2) Diagnose by root cause</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li><strong>Value gap:</strong> KPI not proven → run value validation (before/after, ROI calc), executive read-out.</li>
    <li><strong>Poor fit:</strong> requirement mismatch → reset scope, phased roadmap, or honest exit with reference for core fit.</li>
    <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> low breadth/depth → enablement sprint, power-user program, admin coaching, usage targets.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> sponsor left or cold → re-thread to new EB, apology + plan after incidents, exec-to-exec touch.</li>
    <li><strong>Budget/commercial:</strong> freeze or cuts → step-downs, term trade, consolidation hypothesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Competition:</strong> incumbent push or RFP → counter-proof, neutralize traps, multi-thread.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3) Run the Save Room (weekly)</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Attendees: CS lead (chair), Renewals, AE/AM, Support lead, Exec sponsor (optional).</li>
    <li>Agenda: Top 10 red accounts → cause → play → owner/date → counters → comms plan; then amber trending.</li>
    <li>Artifacts: single board with Health, Risk reason, Play, Last exec touch, Renewal date, Next milestone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4) Escalation mechanics</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Severity matrix: data/security/executive visibility/revenue at risk.</li>
    <li>Comms cadence: Sev-A every 24–48h, Sev-B weekly; one owner; update template.</li>
    <li>Executive brief: situation, impact, actions/owners, asks, next milestone; 10 lines max.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5) Renewal project plan (T-120 to T-0)</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>T-120: validate usage and KPI outcomes; confirm sponsor path; surface legal/commercial risks.</li>
    <li>T-90: propose options (baseline/step-down/expansion); align on success plan for next term.</li>
    <li>T-60: lock terms; pre-wire finance/procurement; counter competitor moves.</li>
    <li>T-30: finalize paper; exec check-in; celebrate value internally at customer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6) Close the loop</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Renewal post-mortem: keep vs. lost; reasons coded; price erosion tracked vs. counters.</li>
    <li>Update play library and examples; share two “saves of the month”.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked examples</h2>

  <h3>Example A — Adoption stall in MM</h3>
  <p><strong>Signals:</strong> WAU/Seats 28%, admins untrained, no KPI tracking.</p>
  <p><strong>Play:</strong> 3-week enablement sprint: admin workshop, power-user cohort, usage targets per team; weekly dashboard.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> WAU/Seats 63%, pilot KPI (−18% cycle time); renewal at flat price, expansion hypothesis agreed.</p>

  <h3>Example B — Sponsor left in Enterprise</h3>
  <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Exec touches 0 in 90 days; new COO; competitor courting ops.</p>
  <p><strong>Play:</strong> CEO-to-COO intro via board link; value read-out with before/after; 60-day success plan; MAP for next term.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Renewal at 102% with two step-downs traded for 12-month term and reference.</p>

  <h3>Example C — Budget freeze</h3>
  <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Finance directive; usage strong; outcomes proven.</p>
  <p><strong>Play:</strong> Step-down scope (2 modules) + term extension + price-hold clause; procurement pre-wire; CFO cost-of-delay model.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Renewal at −7% ARR but 24-month term; competitor blocked; expansion plan when freeze lifts.</p>
