      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>International expansion fails more often than it succeeds. Not because the product is bad but because the entry is rushed, the market is misread, or the offer is copied from the home market without adjustment. Leaders set a revenue target, hire one expensive country manager, buy ads, and wait. Nine months later the board asks why there is no traction and the answer is vague: “the market is different”.</p>
      <p>This guide gives you a practical way to expand with discipline. You will define a thesis, use a simple scorecard to choose markets, decide your entry mode, and localize product and pricing only where it moves the needle. You will run a staged GTM with clear triggers, not hope. You will also prepare exit rules so you can stop early and conserve cash if the bet does not work.</p>
      <p>The focus is on repeatability. You can run this process for one country or a region. You can also use it to decide <em>not</em> to expand yet. The goal is to ship a plan that finance trusts and the team understands. No heavy systems needed — a spreadsheet and a six-page brief are enough.</p>
      <p>Expect concrete examples: a SaaS vendor into DACH with a partner-first motion; a device company into the Nordics using a distributor; and a UK launch where pricing and data residency block adoption until fixed. Use these patterns and adjust to your context.</p>
      <p>If you do this well, you will enter fewer markets but win more of them. You will spend less on vanity and more on what creates adoption: segment focus, right entry mode, strong local proof, and fast feedback loops.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, international expansion is a high-stakes bet. It can fuel massive growth or it can burn through capital with little to show. By following a disciplined framework and setting clear success criteria up front, you replace guesswork with informed choices. Instead of simply pouring money into a new region and hoping for traction, you'll know exactly what conditions signal success — and when to pull the plug if needed. In short, this playbook helps you expand with eyes wide open, so you can win in new markets without costly missteps.</p>

      <h2>Framework at a glance</h2>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>Define a clear thesis and success definition</li>
        <li>Score markets with a simple model; pick a single beachhead</li>
        <li>Choose entry mode: direct, partner or hybrid; sequence roles</li>
        <li>Localize: product, pricing, legal and data (only what matters)</li>
        <li>Build a GTM plan: channels, quotas, enablement and proof</li>
        <li>Set up operations and governance for speed with control</li>
        <li>Use triggers, stage-gates and kill rules to avoid slow failure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The diagram at the end shows the full flow from thesis to kill rules.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>1) Thesis and success definition</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Anchor the why and the bar for success before you spend.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Write the thesis in one line:</strong> “We believe segment X in country Y has Z customers with problem A that our product solves with value B.”</li>
        <li><strong>Set the success bar:</strong> 12-month targets for ARR/revenue, # customers, CAC payback, and time to first proof (first 3 references).</li>
        <li><strong>Decide constraints:</strong> max cash burn, max team size, earliest break-even month, and what you will not do (e.g., no enterprise until we win mid-market).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a one-page thesis + success bar signed by CEO and CFO.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2) Market selection scorecard</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Compare markets objectively and pick a single beachhead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Score 1–5:</strong> ICP density, willingness to pay, competitive intensity, regulation/compliance, language complexity, data residency, partner ecosystem, logistics (if hardware), and go-to-market cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Weighting:</strong> double weight ICP density and willingness to pay; half weight logistics if you are pure SaaS.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> use public data, partner interviews, early customer calls and search volume. Avoid “our board likes it”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Decision:</strong> pick the top market and park the rest. Write <em>why</em> the runner-up lost so you don’t drift into dual focus.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a two-tab sheet (scores + notes) and a short write-up of the chosen market and ICP.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3) Entry mode and sequencing</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Choose how you will sell and in which order you add roles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct:</strong> higher control and margin; slower proof if you lack brand.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner-led:</strong> fast access to accounts; lower control; need strong enablement and deal rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> common for B2B — partner for pipeline, direct for top deals and reference builds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Sequence roles:</strong> start with a market lead + SDR (or partner manager). Add AE only after 2× pipeline coverage is sustained for six weeks. Add PS/CS after first two customers are live.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a role/ramp plan tied to triggers (see section 7).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4) Localization that matters</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Localize only what removes friction; skip vanity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product:</strong> legal entities, data residency, VAT/tax handling, integrations (payments, accounting), language for end-user surfaces (support site, contracts).</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing &amp; packaging:</strong> align to willingness to pay; avoid straight currency conversion; test a local bundle if competitors do.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong> country-specific references or pilots; localized case studies before paid ads.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a localization checklist with owners and dates; a single page of changes vs. home market.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5) GTM plan</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build a simple, repeatable plan for pipeline and conversion.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Channels:</strong> partner-sourced, events with ICP density, targeted outbound, and 2–3 intent keywords. Avoid broad brand spend before references.</li>
        <li><strong>Quotas &amp; coverage:</strong> set conservative first-year quotas; insist on 3.0–3.5× pipeline coverage before hiring the next AE.</li>
        <li><strong>Enablement:</strong> country deck, discovery script, competitive one-pagers, and a legal quick guide for local blockers.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-sale:</strong> activation playbook and first 90-day success plan; do not skip this.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a one-page GTM with channel mix, activity model, quotas, and enablement assets.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6) Operating model &amp; governance</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Run fast without losing control.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>P&amp;L view:</strong> simple country P&amp;L with revenue, COGS, GTM spend, headcount costs, and cash view by quarter.</li>
        <li><strong>Org &amp; reporting:</strong> market lead reports to CRO/COO; finance partner assigned; legal and security named contacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Cadence:</strong> weekly pipeline, monthly review (metrics + decisions), quarterly rebalance. Mirror your global operating rhythm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a one-page charter (roles, decisions, cadence) and an owner list.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>7) Triggers, stage-gates and kill rules</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Replace wishful thinking with clear gates.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hire gate:</strong> add AE when rolling 6-week pipeline coverage ≥ 3.0× and partner-sourced opportunities ≥ 35%.</li>
        <li><strong>Scale gate:</strong> add second cohort when first 3 customers are referenceable and CAC payback &lt; 18 months at local pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Kill rule:</strong> pause spend if win rate &lt; 10% or sales cycle exceeds plan by 50% for two quarters, or if critical localization (e.g., data residency) cannot be solved inside 90 days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> a single page with gates, owners and exact thresholds.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Worked examples</h2>
      <h3>Example A: SaaS into DACH (partner-first)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Strong ICP density in manufacturing; low brand awareness; strict data rules.</p>
      <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Partner-first entry with two system integrators; local data center via existing cloud provider; German support site; pricing +10% vs. home due to higher WTP.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Two references in 120 days; win rate 18% after localization; add first AE when coverage holds at 3.2×.</p>

      <h3>Example B: Devices into the Nordics (distributor)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Hardware margins; logistics cost matters; small but affluent market.</p>
      <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Exclusive distributor with quarterly rebate; SLA-based install partners; country manager hired only after 300 units/quarter run-rate.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Positive cash conversion; stock turns improve; direct team deferred until pull justifies it.</p>

      <h3>Example C: UK launch blocked by pricing &amp; residency</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Buyers require GBP pricing and UK data residency.</p>
      <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Add GBP price list; enable UK region on cloud; two lighthouse pilots in public sector.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> First 5 customers; CAC payback 15 months; proceed to second AE.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Metrics to watch</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pipeline coverage and mix (partner vs. direct)</li>
        <li>Win rate by segment and language</li>
        <li>Sales cycle vs. plan; time to first reference</li>
        <li>Activation time and NPS for first 90 days</li>
        <li>CAC payback and local gross margin</li>
        <li>Percent of deals blocked by compliance/localization gaps</li>

    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common mistakes (and fixes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Copy-paste GTM:</strong> fix by running a small local proof before paid demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiring too early:</strong> fix with hire gates tied to coverage and proof, not quarter dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring compliance:</strong> fix with a one-page legal checklist and named owners.</li>
        <li><strong>Too many markets:</strong> fix by choosing one beachhead and writing down why others wait.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanity localization:</strong> fix by prioritizing changes that move conversion, not cosmetics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>90-day launch plan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Days 0–7:</strong> finalize thesis, success bar and scorecard; pick market.</li>
        <li><strong>Days 8–21:</strong> partner interviews; pick 2 partners; draft localization checklist; create UK/DE landing page variant.</li>
        <li><strong>Days 22–45:</strong> pilots scoped; legal + data residency plan signed; country deck and discovery script ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Days 46–75:</strong> first events with ICP density; outbound to 100 target accounts; weekly partner pipeline review.</li>
        <li><strong>Days 76–90:</strong> first two pilots live; hire gate review; decide on adding AE or extending pilot phase.</li>
      </ul>
