      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Most plans treat headcount as a single number. Reality is about work. Work creates demand for specific roles at specific times with real ramp to productivity. When this is not modeled, you miss targets or margins. The fix is not more hiring or a freeze. The fix is a plan that connects demand signals to capacity and then stages hiring with clear triggers.</p>
      <p>Headcount planning is a monthly practice, not an annual event. It links the revenue model, the delivery model and the budget. It defines what work must be done, who will do it, and when they will be able to deliver steady output. It also makes visible the constraints that limit throughput such as manager spans, enablement bandwidth and tooling.</p>
      <p>This guide shows a practical way to run headcount planning that you can maintain in a spreadsheet. It is simple on purpose. Each step creates one artifact that you will use in the next step. You will translate demand into units of work, define roles with realistic ramp, build a capacity model, stage hiring in cohorts, map budget to triggers and run a tight governance loop.</p>
      <p>The goal is not perfect precision. The goal is a plan that is easy to understand and easy to adjust. Finance sees the same picture as the functions. Leaders know why each role exists and what good looks like. New hires start when the work is real, not when a guess from last quarter says so.</p>
      <p>Expect to see numbers, not slogans. You will see examples for sales capacity, customer success portfolios and engineering throughput. You will see what to do when conversion slips, when activation spikes, and when teams want more people but the constraint sits elsewhere. Use the examples as patterns. Adapt them to your model and your segments.</p>
      <p>If you do this work well you spend with intent, avoid whiplash between hiring and freezes, and ship the plan you sold to the board. If you skip it you get the usual outcome. Late hires, rushed onboarding, overloaded managers and a plan that drifts away from reality within weeks.</p>

      <h2>The framework at a glance</h2>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>Translate demand into work units</li>
        <li>Define roles and realistic ramp</li>
        <li>Build a capacity model and expose constraints</li>

      </ul>
      <p>A simple diagram below illustrates the flow from demand to governance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>1) Translate demand into work units</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Move from targets to concrete units of work per function and segment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sales:</strong> derive required qualified opportunities by segment and channel using win rate and cycle length.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> derive required intent signals or leads by source using conversion to sales accepted stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer success:</strong> derive accounts by lifecycle stage and risk class based on retention and expansion targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Product and engineering:</strong> if velocity is stable, estimate capacity in story points per squad. If not, use capacity blocks per squad and per quarter.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> derive tickets by queue with SLA and complexity classes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> New ARR target is 4.0 million. Historic win rate is 20 percent. Average deal size is 40 thousand. You need 500 qualified opportunities. Sixty percent will be SDR sourced, forty percent partner and inbound. Now the question is how many SDRs and AEs you need to handle that volume at each stage, not how many heads you can afford in general.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A one page demand table per function with rows for segments. Show the assumptions that matter. Win rate, cycle, conversion, average size.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2) Define roles and realistic ramp</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Model time to steady output for each role.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a month by month ramp profile for each role. Include training, first live work, first independent work and steady state.</li>
        <li>Capture manager span limits and enablement capacity. Do not add reports if spans are already at limit.</li>
        <li>Use time to first revenue or time to first resolution as the first real milestone, not badge completion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> AEs reach full productivity in month five. Month one is shadow. Month two builds pipeline. First closes show in month three. CSMs stabilize portfolios in month four. SDRs reach steady state in month three.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A short numeric profile per role. Month 1 to Month N with expected percent of steady output.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3) Build a capacity model and expose constraints</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Show the gap between required work and available capacity by quarter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Combine demand with ramp and steady capacity per role.</li>
        <li>Use simple per role throughput. An AE can work N active opportunities per month at target stage. An SDR can create M qualified opportunities per month. A CSM can manage K accounts given average complexity.</li>
        <li>Expose constraints. Manager spans, onboarding seats, enablement bandwidth, tools and data quality often limit throughput more than raw headcount.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> You need 500 qualified opportunities. Each SDR at steady state creates 25 per month. With a three month ramp, two SDRs that start in September will create only 50 in Q4, not 150. The model shows a gap and also flags the SDR manager span risk if a third cohort is added without a team lead.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A single table per function that shows required versus available per quarter. Keep a versioned copy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4) Stage hiring with clear triggers and stop rules</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Tie each hire to leading indicators that prove the need.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define green light triggers by function. Rolling four week inbound volume, pipeline coverage by tier, activation backlog, defect backlog, ticket SLA breaches are good triggers.</li>
        <li>Define stop rules in advance. If triggers fall below threshold for six weeks, pause the next cohort.</li>
        <li>Start in cohorts to reduce onboarding load and to line up with enablement calendars.</li>
        <li>Define who can flip a cohort from planned to go. Put a date and a name on the decision.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Six SDRs in three cohorts of two. Trigger is inbound intent above 900 per month for six weeks and conversion to SQL above 12 percent. Stop rule is conversion below 9 percent for six weeks. If triggered, pause the next cohort and run enablement sprints to fix message fit before resuming hiring.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A one page cohort plan with role, count, target start, trigger, stop rule and manager assignment.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5) Align budget, finance and approvals</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Budget and approvals match the staged plan and expire if triggers fail.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Map each cohort to an all in cost curve by quarter. Include salary, benefits, tools and enablement.</li>
        <li>Pre approve roles with a valid through date. The approval remains valid only while triggers hold.</li>
        <li>Ensure HRIS and ATS reflect the same cohorts, job levels and spans.</li>
        <li>Add a simple cash view for the board if needed. Show run rate impact by quarter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Finance approves a pool for two AE hires per quarter if pipeline coverage stays above 3.5 times target. If coverage drops for two months the approval expires and must be renewed with an updated model.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A budget table and a short note on level mix to protect pay bands and spans.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6) Review monthly and rebalance quarterly</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Keep plan and reality close and correct drift early.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> compare demand signals, actual capacity and active hiring. Mark each cohort as go, hold or stop. Inspect 2–3 fast moving metrics (e.g., conversion to SQL, ramp time to first win, activation backlog days).</li>
        <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> revisit role mix, spans and level distribution. Update ramp profiles using data from recent cohorts. Stress test two biggest risks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Conversion in a new segment drops. Rather than add SDRs you add one partner manager and two enablement sprints. Conversion returns to plan and the next SDR cohort proceeds.</p>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A short review note with the decisions taken, plus updated tables.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Worked examples</h2>
      <h3>Example A: Sales capacity by tier</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Enterprise deals take seven months. Mid market takes three. Win rate in enterprise is higher but volume is lower.</p>
      <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Keep two enterprise AEs and three mid market AEs. Stage one more mid market AE only if tier B pipeline holds at two times target for eight weeks and average cycle stays under ninety days.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Targets are met without overspend. Without ramp modeling you would have hired one quarter too late.</p>

      <h3>Example B: Customer success against activation volume</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Three large customers go live in the same month and activation backlog risks SLA breach.</p>
      <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Hire two CSMs in one cohort two months before the first go live. Trigger is signed SOW dates plus a four week buffer. Stop rule is a slip of more than four weeks for two of the three projects.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Activation stays within SLA. Expansion happens on schedule. Churn risk remains low.</p>

      <h3>Example C: Engineering throughput through level changes</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Feature teams miss dates. Leaders ask for four more engineers.</p>
      <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Promote two senior ICs to staff. Drop one planned hire. Create a shared platform track to remove repeated work.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Cycle time drops and predictability improves without adding cost. The model shows the bottleneck was leadership bandwidth and platform debt, not raw capacity.</p>
